## Summary

Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."


Roughly 72,500 roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact.

The amount of qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments is far too small to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. The ratio of employees needed to hire and employees in the mentorship program is roughly 48 to 1.

However, if the requirements of being in the mentorship program were tweaked, there would be more employees eligible to mentor new employees. As of now, the mentorship program only allows employees born in the year 1965. If we expanded this to include employees born in 1964 as well, that would greatly increase the mentorship program.

This would bring the mentorship program to 19,905 employees, making the ratio around 3 to 1, ensuring that each new employee will get the best training possible.



Using the count function in SQL, we can also see that male employees outweigh the female employees.

In the hiring process, an initiative to hire more female employees would go a long way for Pewlett Hackard's diversity.
